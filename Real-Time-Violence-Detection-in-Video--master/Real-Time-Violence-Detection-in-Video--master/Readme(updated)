In surveillance systems, detecting violence quickly and accurately is crucial for law enforcement and city safety. Existing violence detection methods often prioritize either speed or accuracy, 
without considering their adaptability to different video formats. Our paper introduces a real-time violence detector using deep learning. Our model combines a CNN for spatial feature extraction 
with an LSTM for temporal relation learning, balancing generality, accuracy, and response time. Our model achieves a 98% accuracy with a speed of 131 frames/sec, surpassing previous methods in
both accuracy and speed for violence detection across various video sources.
